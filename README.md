This project involves the analysis of Peri-Stimulus Time Histograms (PSTH) from neural electrophysiological data collected from a macaque monkey during a visual search task.

Before diving into the analysis, please watch the "Task.mov" video, which provides a detailed overview of the experimental task.

Our analysis focuses on comparing and understanding neural firing rates and activity patterns using PSTH plots. Prior to analysis, the data underwent comprehensive preprocessing, including filtering, spike sorting, trial correction, and the removal of noisy trials, ensuring clean and reliable data for study.
